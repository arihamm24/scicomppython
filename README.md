Assignments and Projects for Scientific Computing with Python Certification through freeCodeCamp/ Prof. Charles Severance at UMich

<h1> Assignments </h2>
There is a folder in this repo that shows the source code of my completed course assignments. I completed these and met the required criteria based on my learning and analysis, and there are several correct ways to solve these problems. You can find them in the Assignments tab of the PY4E site.
These assignments demonstrate my understanding and application of Python concepts like dictionaries, functions, list, iterations, etc. 
<h1>Projects</h1>
These assignments were completed based on provided source code on Replitt from FreeCodeCamp. I will copy the source code of my solutions and attach below the Replitt links I submitted for certification

<h1>Reflection</h1>
Though this is far from the last experience I will have learning and experimenting with Python, I feel confident in my progress thus far. This is my first time programming with Python and I believed I learned new ways to think about problem-solving that perhaps were not possible with other languages I've learned. I feel like a built a strong foundation and plan to continue learning the language and its applications. This portfolio, more than anything, is to document my progress, and perhaps give myself a reference in the future. When all else fails, go back to basics. This repo is showing how I built my basics. I completed this certifcation in preparation for AP Computer Science A and/or CS 1301 at GA Tech.
